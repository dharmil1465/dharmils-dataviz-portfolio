# Wireframes / Storyboards

Using the sketches developed in Part I, I expanded them into **wireframes and draft visualizations** that map directly to the story arc:

## 1. Roadmap: The Student Journey
We begin with a simple roadmap visualization that outlines the path of an international student:
- Graduate in India → Master’s in the U.S. → STEM OPT → H-1B Through a Job → Green Card → Permanent Life in America.  
This roadmap sets context for our audience, many of whom are students, by showing how education, work authorization, and visas connect.

## 2. Job Market Dynamics
### A. Tech vs. Overall Job Postings

- Tech postings fell **36%** since 2020.  
- Overall job postings still grew **+4%**, highlighting an uneven market.  
This sets the stage: it feels harder to get jobs in tech, but the story doesn’t end here

### B. Sectoral Winners and Losers
- Declining: Pharma (−28.1%), Manufacturing (−21.8%), Electrical & Industrial Engineering.  
- Growing: Chemical Engineering (+25.8%), Beauty & Wellness (+5.8%), Sports (+3.9%), Finance (+3.3%), Logistics (+0.5%).  
This suggests opportunities are shifting across sectors, not vanishing.

## 3. Immigration Deadlock
### A. H-1B Applications vs. Approvals 
- FY2025: **440,000 applications** vs. only **85,000 visas issued**.  
- A lottery system makes the journey uncertain, regardless of skill.

## 4. H-1B Today: Where the Jobs Are
![Top employers bar chart](./images/top_employers.png)  
- Amazon (10,044 approvals) dominates, followed by TCS (5,505), Microsoft (5,189), Meta (5,123), Apple (4,202), Google (4,181).  
- Highlights reliance on both U.S. tech firms and Indian IT service companies.

## 5. Student Enrollment and Impact
- **Graduate students**: 502,291 (+8%, record high).  
- **OPT participants**: 242,782 (+22%, record high).  
- **Undergraduate students**: 342,875 (−1%).  
- **Non-degree students**: 38,742 (−12%).  
Despite uncertainty, demand from international students continues to rise—especially in graduate and OPT pathways.

## Draft Narrative Flow (for Shorthand)
- **Context:** Student roadmap (personalizes journey).  
- **Challenge 1:** Tech slowdown (is it harder for everyone?).  
- **Challenge 2:** Uneven industry trends (some shrinking, others growing).  
- **Challenge 3:** H-1B bottleneck (lottery system, systemic deadlock).  
- **Challenge 4:** Where the jobs are (top employers, concentrated demand).  
- **Closing:** Enrollment resilience (students still choosing U.S., but facing uncertainty).

# User Research

## Target Audience
The intended audience for this project is **graduate students, international job seekers, and general readers interested in U.S. immigration policy**.  

For user testing, I recruited three representative individuals:  
- **Interviewee 1 (mid-20s):** A current master’s student in the U.S. exploring OPT → H-1B transition.  
- **Interviewee 2 (late-20s):** An Indian professional currently working in the U.S. on OPT.  
- **Interviewee 3 (early-30s):** A peer with no visa background, representing the general policy-aware reader.  

This group ensured feedback captured both *lived experience* and *outside perspective*.

## Interview Script

**Goal:** Test clarity, flow, and emotional resonance of the storyboards.  

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Gauge clarity of intro | What story do you perceive from the opening map and employer chart? |
| Evaluate job postings line chart | Is the drop vs. growth trend clear? What confuses you? |
| Assess lottery funnel impact | Does the funnel visualization effectively communicate the challenge? |
| Check enrollment trends | Do the stacked bars make sense? Is labeling clear? |
| Identify strong/weak visuals | Which chart felt most impactful? Least impactful? Why? |
| Collect improvement ideas | What would make the visuals easier to understand? |

## Interview Findings

**Summary of Insights:**  
- The intro visuals (map + employers) were widely understood as showing **where and who benefits**.  
- The lottery funnel resonated strongly; users described it as “eye-opening” and “unfair but real.”  
- The job postings chart needed more **direct labels** to highlight the 36% vs 4% difference.  
- Student enrollment trends were engaging, but interviewees requested clearer color differentiation and year labels.  

**Detailed Table:**

| Questions | Interview 1 (Grad student) | Interview 2 (OPT professional) | Interview 3 (General reader) |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Roadmap (student journey) | “Helpful to see the full path—it makes it personal.” | “Accurate representation of my own process.” | “Now I get how visas and work steps connect.” |
| Job postings (tech vs overall) | “I noticed the steep tech drop, but the labels could be bigger.” | “Resonated—my field feels much tighter now.” | “Clear enough, but I needed context on why overall stayed positive.” |
| Industry shifts (winners/losers) | “Interesting—hadn’t thought of beauty & wellness or logistics as growth areas.” | “Finance and logistics make sense, that’s where hiring is.” | “The table is a bit text-heavy, maybe a chart would pop more.” |
| H-1B applications vs approvals | “The funnel hit me—it shows how stacked the odds are.” | “Exactly what my peers are facing, felt very real.” | “Lottery idea clicked immediately, unfair but memorable.” |
| Top employers | “Amazon and TCS dominating wasn’t surprising, but seeing numbers was.” | “Good to see Indian IT companies included—it reflects reality.” | “The names gave credibility—felt data-driven.” |
| Enrollment trends | “Graduate growth was encouraging but colors need clearer separation.” | “OPT rise stood out—I’m in that group.” | “Confusing at first with four lines, but overall message was clear.” |
| Most impactful | “Lottery funnel.” | “OPT growth chart.” | “Roadmap + funnel combination.” |
| Suggestions | “More annotation on % changes.” | “Link OPT growth to H-1B bottleneck explicitly.” | “Simplify table into a small multiples chart.” |

**Planned Changes for Part III:**  
- Add direct **annotations (% drop, % growth)** to job postings chart.  
- Revise color palette for **enrollment levels** (clearer separation).  
- Add **absolute value labels** for OPT totals.  
- Explore side-by-side student comparison (India vs China) if scope permits.

I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) to help refine my storyboard structure, draft the user interview script, and format the findings table. Narrative inspiration came from the YouTube video [The American Dream or Nightmare?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzWBC_uY6hE), but all visualizations are re-created using official public data (USCIS, Indeed, Open Doors).
