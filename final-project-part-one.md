# Final Project Part I — The American Dream or the American Nightmare? The Journey of H-1B Aspirants

---

## High-Level Summary
For decades, the United States has attracted the world’s brightest minds, fueling its status as a global superpower. Immigrant entrepreneurs like Elon Musk (South Africa), Jensen Huang (Taiwan), and Sergey Brin (Soviet Union) shaped revolutions in EVs, AI, and the internet, while countless Indian engineers and students powered America’s innovation engine.  

Yet in recent years, the once-clear path to the “American Dream” has increasingly resembled an “American Nightmare.” This project tells the story of how labor market shifts, immigration deadlocks, and new policy hurdles have complicated the journey for Indian students and skilled workers. By weaving together labor market data, H-1B visa records, and international student trends, the project highlights the widening gap between aspiration and reality.

## Project Structure (Story Arc)

### 1. H-1B Today: Where the Jobs Are
- **Geography:** USCIS data shows California, Texas, New York, and New Jersey as leading states for H-1B petitions, reflecting concentrations in tech hubs and financial centers.  
- **Employers:** The top petitioners in FY2025 include Amazon (10,044 approvals), Tata Consultancy Services (5,505), Microsoft (5,189), Meta (5,123), Apple (4,202), and Google (4,181). This highlights how both U.S. tech giants and Indian IT service firms drive demand for skilled workers.  

### 2. The American Nightmare (Current Challenges)

#### 2.1 Job Market Dynamics
- **Tech sector slowdown**: Between 2020 and July 2025, tech-related job postings dropped 36%, even while the overall job market grew by 4%.  
- **Uneven sectoral growth**:  
  - Declining fields: Pharma, Manufacturing, Electrical & Industrial Engineering.  
  - Growing fields: Beauty & Wellness, Sports, Banking & Finance, Logistics.  

#### 2.2 Immigration Deadlock
- **H-1B visa lottery**: Only 85,000 visas issued annually, but 440,000 applications filed in 2025. The journey depends heavily on chance.  
- **New H-1B visa fees**: Proposed one-time fee of $100,000 per applicant (≈₹88 lakhs) for companies like Infosys and Wipro. Existing H-1B holders unaffected, but this policy may force companies to be far more selective in hiring.  

#### 2.3 Impact on Indian Students and Workers
- **STEM OPT extension (2008)**: Created a “new highway” for Indian students, allowing up to 3 years of post-graduation work experience.  
- **International student enrollment (Open Doors 2023/24)**:  
  - Graduate: 502,291 students (+8%, all-time high).  
  - OPT: 242,782 students (+22%, record high).  
  - Undergraduate: 342,875 students (−1%).  
  - Non-degree: 38,742 students (−12% after prior growth).  

### 3. Looking Ahead
- How students, workers, and employers adapt to these constraints.  
- Whether the “American Dream” remains viable for Indian talent—or whether a new “Indian Dream” is taking shape back home.

## Method and Medium
- **Visualization**: Tableau for bar/line/small-multiple charts; Illustrator/Figma for infographic elements.  
- **Narrative Platform**: Shorthand to combine visuals, text, and story arc in an interactive scrollytelling style.  
- **Repository**: GitHub Pages for progress logs, sketches, and data links.  
- **Workflow**: Collect data (USCIS, Open Doors, Indeed) → clean in Excel/Python → visualize in Tableau → assemble narrative in Shorthand.

## AI Acknowledgements
I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) to help me structure the narrative, align the content with course rubric requirements, and draft the GitHub markdown file for Part I. I also referred to a YouTube case study video that provided context, transcript excerpts, and illustrative charts about H-1B immigration challenges. All data visualizations in the final project will be recreated from official, publicly accessible sources (e.g., USCIS, DOL, Open Doors, Indeed) rather than directly reused from the video.
